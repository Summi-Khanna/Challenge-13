## Technologies:

It supports Python 3.7 and has been constructed using jupyter lab notebook.

Additionally, the following packages/libraries are used to run the analysis:

- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - for analyzing data
- [tensor flow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/) - for creating neural network
- [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn/) - for building machine learning models
- [pathlib](https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/) - for creating objected oriented file modules
